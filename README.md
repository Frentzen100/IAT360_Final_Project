Because the original dataset the model trained on is too big, the original dataset is from “Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000” in Kaggle.

For testing our web application, we extracted 70 random images from “Multiple Skin Disease Detection and Classification” in Kaggle for each class so that there are 10 images in each classes. This is stored in the folder “Testing_Images”.
